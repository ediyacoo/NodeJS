       cle File / \c H. M. Shalaby.
260    \a [S.I. : \b s.n.], \c 2006.
520    \a Through a careful failure investigation of boiler tubes that suffere
       d from corrosion due to hot spot formation, an attempt was made to clar
       ify some ambiguities about the sequence of events that take place durin
       g this corrosion phenomenon. In addition, the role of copper compounds 
       was critically assessed. It is argued that the root cause of hot spot f
       ormation is the localized excessive heat flux. The localized overheatin
       g and resultant growth of nonprotective magnetite (Fe3O4) scale were co
       nsidered the primary factors in the initiation of hot spots. On the oth
       er hand, caustic attack was assumed to contribute to further growth of 
       the scale and sustained development of the hot spot at later stages. Th
       is contribution was proposed to occur via localized attack of the nonpr
       otective magnetite scale, leading to an increased pore size and, in tur
       n, an increased rate of diffusion of oxygen-bearing species. A previous
        conclusion that elemental copper diffuses to the metal grain boundarie
       s and causes galvanic corrosion was discounted. This was based on the f
       act that copper was not detected at the grain boundaries whereas copper
        oxide was observed in all tube surfaces separated from the metal subst
       rate by magnetite layers. The hot spot formation process was judged to 
       be autocatalytic as the build up of local, concentrated solutions throu
       gh wick-type boiling required the presence of a nonprotective porous ma
       gnetite layer. Â© 2006, NACE International.

520    \a This study assessed the magnitude of groundwater pollution emanating
        from direct infiltration of pollutants from oil lakes and contaminated
        seawater used for fire fighting. In addition, the study examined the p
       ossibility of contamination due to infiltrating rainwater and subsurfac
       e contamination from damaged oil well casings during the period of stud
       y. Water fields of Raudhatain, Umm Al-Aish, Umm Gudair, Wafra and Sulai
       biyah were considered in this study. The groundwater pollution study wa
       s subjected t o several constraints including access, mines, and mechan
       ical and electrical problems of wells, which hindered the precise evalu
       ation of contaminant levels of groundwater. The major conclusions drawn
        from the present study are: (a) direct infiltration o f oil from oil l
       akes is limited to a depth of about 2 m in the Raudhatain and Umm AI-Ai
       sh areas; (b) water samples collected from certain wells in heavily con
       taminated areas of Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish show fluctuations in poll
       utant concentration levels, but samples collected during July-October 1
       992 indicate very minor pollution, the present levels of which are insi
       gnificant and may be neglected for all practical purposes; and (c) wate
       r samples collected from other monitoring wells in different water fiel
       ds do not show any levels of pollution as a result of the crisis. Howev
       er, nondetection of pollution at selected monitoring wells does not nec
       essarily mean no actual pollution of groundwater.
520    \a At Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish, groundwater pollution emanating from 
       the infiltration of either rainwater leaching out surface pollutants or
        contaminated water used for fire fighting might have reached the water
        table level but not the intake sections of wells, which are about 5-10
        m below water table levels. Similarly, at Wafra and Umm Gudair, the le
       akage from damaged well casings might exist but not have yet reached mo
       nitoring wells during this study period. Hence, recognizing the importa
       nce of freshwater fields at Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish, the assessment 
       of the expected long-term pollution of these areas by undertaking compr
       ehensive studies is strongly recommended.

520    \a The natural environment comprises complex relationships between livi
       ng organisms (animals, plants and microorganisms) and their physical en
       vironment (water, soil and climate). Nature conservation seeks to estab
       lish a harmonious relationship between human activity and other living 
       things and the physical environment. The establishment of National Park
       s/Nature Reserves not only c an preserve the natural ecological system 
       within the parks, but can also positively contribute to a regional ecol
       ogical balance, natural climatic patterns, scientific research, histori
       c preservation, recreational opportunity and international tourism (IUC
       N and UNEP, 1984; UNESCO, 1984; Batisse, 1982; UNESCO and UNEP, 1984). 
       In Kuwait, natural renewable resources have been utili sed heavily, whi
       ch has often resulted in their rapid deterioration. The misuse of resou
       rces through uncontrolled activities, e.g., overgrazing, uprooting wood
       y shrubs, hunting reptiles and birds, off-route use of vehicles, has re
       sulted in many negative impacts and, in many cases, irreversible losses
        of flora, fauna, and potential recreational grounds. In spite of this 
       situation and until 1980, Kuwait had no protected or managed area where
        the potential for desert parks and the protection and improvement of n
       atural resources could be explored. In response to this situation, the 
       Kuwait Municipality designated areas in its land u se master plan, Kuwa
       it Master Plan, Review 2 (KMPR2), for national parks/nature reserves. A
       lso in 1980, Kuwait Institute for
520    \a Scientific Research (KISR) was requested by Kuwait Municipality to u
       ndertake a feasibility study on establishing national parks/nature rese
       rves. This preliminary study identified an area in the Northeast of Kuw
       ait that combines a variety of animal and plant species with significan
       t landscape features. It is a large area of diverse plant and animal li
       fe with interesting physiographic features, good accessibility, and eas
       e of protection (Taha and Omar, 1982). To promote an 'action plan' for 
       the development of this area, Kuwait Municipality collected detailed sc
       ientific information on the ecological components of the designated par
       k and assessed and proposed concrete management and administration plan
       s for the envisaged park. The second phase of the project, Select ion a
       nd Criteria for Establishment of National Parks/Nature Reserves in Kuwa
       it, was initiated early in 1984 for 22 months (Omar et al., 1984). The 
       major emphasis was on identifying area sizes and uses within the design
       ated area, ensuring the legality of using the site for national park/na
       ture reserve purposes for the present and future, and making appropriat
       e recommendations for the management plan. KISR was requested to undert
       ake the following tasks: 1 . Investigate protection measures for the pa
       rk area 2 . Assess zoning of the park area 3 . Determine suitable plant
       s, wildlife and habitats 4 . Recommend

520    \a The project was undertaken to develop national guidelines for waterp
       roofing of building basements. In developing the guidelines, background
        data was obtained on local conditions with respect to waterproofing ma
       terials, construction practices and leakage. The project also covered t
       he characterisation of soil and water in different parts of Kuwait, the
        evaluation of physical properties of locally available water-proofing 
       materials, and the evaluation of water drainage control methods suitabl
       e for local conditions. Information obtained from the soil and water ch
       aracterization, with regard to the concentration and distribution o f c
       hemical substances that are harmful to waterproofing materials, will be
        useful in specifying appropriate materials for new construction as wel
       l as for the repair of existing basements. Evaluation of physical prope
       rties of the locally available waterproofing materials provided informa
       tion for determining, the suitability of the materials for use under lo
       cal conditions. Wit h the large number of waterproofing materials avail
       able in the local market, minimum performance criteria were established
        for use in selecting suitable materials for specific applications. The
        evaluation of water drainage control methods for their suitability to 
       the local soil and site conditions resulted sidelines on effective drai
       nage control methods for local conditions. T he information developed i
       n the four parts of this study (Part 1: Overview on Barrier Systems and
        Local Conditions,
520    \a Part ll: Chemical Concentrations and Distribution in the Soil and Gr
       oundwater, Part IH- Testing and Evaluation of waterproofing Materials, 
       and Part 1V: Water Drainage Control Methods) was utilising the developm
       ent of a national guide for waterproofing covering both new basements a
       nd remedial measures for existing basements, This final report is compo
       sed of two volumes.  Volume I includes an overview of the project, wate
       rproofing, system design considerations, waterproofing, of new basement
       s and remedial measures for existing basements, while Volume 11 include
       s a draft national waterproofing, guide.  The guide includes detailed a
       nd complete specifications of construction methods for suitable waterpr
       oofing, materials to improve the handling and installation procedures o
       n construction sites.  Procedures to remedy existing leaking basements 
       were identified.  The national guide for waterproofing covers all aspec
       ts of waterproofing to insure a watertight structure and to correct exi

520    \a The existing interrelationships between nutrition and other quality 
       attributes of food have been emphasized in recent years. However, curre
       nt interest, rhetoric and emphasis on nutrition have exceeded scientist
        ability to respond from an adequate factual base. One of the key resea
       rch needs is an updating of information on the nutritional composition 
       of foods. This currently is receiving a great deal of attention because
        of the regulatory nutrition labelling proposals for foods. The bioavai
       lability or utilizability of nutrients in food in relation to human hea
       lth and the nutrient stability during processing and distribution are o
       ther areas in which research is needed. But the most important, however
       , is encouragement and support to provide reliable scientific informati
       on to consumers, legislative leaders and all members of our society. Ma
       lnutrition, which means that the body i s not supplied with a sufficien
       t amount of each nutrient, contributes to health problems. Malnourishme
       nt can be caused by not having enough food to supply the needed nutrien
       ts or by not eating the combination of foods that will supply the neede
       d nutrients., A person can be overweight because he is consuming foods 
       containing too many calories and yet be malnourished because he is not 
       getting the nutrients needed for optimal building or repairing of tissu
       es and for regulation of body processes. There are more people malnouri
       shed because of nutritional ignorance and misinformation than because o
       f poverty. Many facts of good nutrition for humans are well known. Why 
       are some of us ill fed? Indifference, ignorance, careless habits such a
       s
520    \a skipping breakfast or lunch, omitting the four basic foods, indulgin
       g in food faddism and setting poor dietary examples for children are im
       portant reasons why many people are poorly nourished. Our income does d
       etermine the amount and kinds of food we ca n buy, but the more we know
        about nutrients, their food sources, how our body uses them and how we
        can cook food so that nutrients are not wasted, the better we can feed
        our families. The need for the education of food buyers in all income 
       groups is important since using a variety of foods prepared in a variet
       y of ways provides one of the best guarantees of an adequate diet. All 
       homemakers should know about nutrition so that they will be able to sel
       ect and prepare foods that will keep them and their families in good he
       alth. The report of the FAO (1962) expressed concern about the lack of 
       national food composition tables and st ressed the importance of establ
       ishing such tables without delay. A suggestion was made that a regional
        table should be compiled based on analyses already carried out in diff
       erent countries. The importance of such information has also been recog
       nised by workers who have prepared tables based on the limited data ava
       ilable in their own countries. These include the Tables by Abdou (1970)
        and Abdulnabi et aL (1961 and 1962). Most of these tables were incompl
       ete or of limited scope. Furthermore, since many foods are common to se
       veral countries in the Middle East, there was an obvious need for more 
       comprehensive data on the entire area. The need for a set of tables for
        a particular region or area is a question often raised. For the Middle
        East, the answer seems quite
520    \a clear. Many fruits and vegetables and leafy plants are consumed in s
       ignificant quantities that are not normally eaten in other areas. If th
       e contribution of such foods is not included in the calculations of nut
       rient intake, erroneous estimates may be obtained.

520    \a Laboratory experiments were carried out to study water kinematics in
       duced by air bubble barriers, to evaluate their effectiveness in protec
       ting water intakes from jellyfish attack.  The experiments were perform
       ed in a re-circulating wave flume under various water depths, unidirect
       ional currents, air discharge rates and wave conditions.  Neutrally buo
       yant floats were used to simulate jellyfish movement.  It was found tha
       t an air bubble barrier alone is not adequate protection, and a net is 
       recommended downstream of the barrier to stop jellyfish moving towards 
       the intakes.

       corporate plans of the organizations. Based on the current stocks of ma
       npower categories, the forecast focuses on the changes in the energy ma
       nning levels needed in the future. The key parameters are turnover and 
       growth. The study outlines the appropriate methodology, presents a case

520    \a Use of cool storage conventional air-conditioning plants has a poten
       tial for reducing peak power demand on utilities.  A unit cooling cost 
       in fils/kWhc, representing the combined result of technical and economi
       c analyses, has been developed and applied to the study of the cost-ben
       efit of using, cool storage.  Residential and non-residential buildings
       , having different types of conventional air-conditioning systems, were
        analyzed on the basis of unit cooling capacity along with a few select
       ed buildings as example cases.  The results show that for all types of 
       buildings and air-conditioning systems using chilled water for cooling 
       distribution, using cool storage is economically highly viable.  For th
       e direct expansion systems, the advantages are limited.  In Kuwait, the
        availability of heavily subsidized electricity, offers very little ben
       efit to the user from adopting cool storage and its major beneficiary i
       s the government.  Changes in tariff structure for energy and power hav
       e been recommended to promote large scale use of cool storage as an eff
       ective tool for energy and power management in Kuwait.

520    \a This Development Study-Agricultural Master Plan has been made possib
       le by the initiative from PAAFR, with partial support from KFAS, which 
       together commissioned KISR to carry out a detailed Development Study an
       d prepare this long-term Master Plan. The Master Plan as contained here
       in, is supported by back-up detailed information in separate documents.
        i.e. Appendix I and II, and Task Reports and Specialised Study Documen
       ts. The goal of the Master Plan is to guide the development of a sustai
       nable agricul ture. The objectives are to: (1) increase crop and animal
        yields and productivity in ways that will, assure reasonable economic 
       returns, conserve water and labour per unit of output, and minimise adv
       erse environmental effects, and (2) establish an effective marketing sy
       stem. Supporting objectives are to: (3) increase the human resource and
        organisational effectiveness of the agricultural sector, with more foc
       us on education and management, so as to better absorb the infusion of 
       advanced technology and better manage the intricacies of Plan implement
       ation, and (4) implement financial incentives that will both attract th
       e private sector to agricultural investment, and also assure reasonable
        and suitable economic returns to the participants, while maintaining a
       dvantageous cost/benefit implications for the public sector. The genera
       l strategies for fulfilling the objectives are to reduce the number of 
       priority commodities (to 11); establish quantitative and qualitative ta
       rgets for production of each; transfer and adapt modern production prac
       tices and know-how; detail the other interventions needed to achieve th
       e targets;
520    \a emphasise reliance on the private sector; assure the financial and e
       conomic viability of the production operations; organise the implementa
       tion of the plan; and, schedule, budget and analyse the Plan in its ent
       irety. The specific strategies for fulfilling the objectives are to:
520    \a employ technology that will conserve the land and minimise adverse i
       mpacts on the environment, contribute to agricultu ral education and ex
       tension expertise on the part of all interested Kuwaitis and positively
        influence the social benefits of jobs, careers, and economic diversifi
       cation, develop the infrastructure to levels that will ensure sustainab
       ility, and focus the plan to yield returns that are high enough for Kuw
       aiti owners, yet not unreasonable from a cost standpoint for the public
        sector. The interventions to be used are of five types: technology tra
       nsfer costs haring grants, capital projects, appli ed research interven
       tions, institutional strengthening interventions and financial incentiv
       e interventions. Over-all the farme rs will be provided incentives to i
       nfuse quality enhancing, yield-improving, labour-saving, and water-cons
       erving advanced technologies into their operations. Private sector inve
       stments in technology will increase by KD 88 million over the plan peri
       od, and gross revenues will be increased annually by KD 140 million, wi
       th a financial rate of return of 31% and a pay-back of 6.2 years, by th
       e end of plan period. Production will be increased 6 fold and labour pr
       oductivity by 2-5 fold,
520    \a with 20-200% improvements in water use efficiency. The plan will yie
       ld 60% self -sufficiency in the priority commodities, even with a proje
       cted 2.3 fold increase in population. Yield improvements will result fr
       om achievement of international standards i n productivity, and will be
        achievable on only 69% of the already allocated land. The transfer of 
       the technology, the use of model farms, and the retrofitting of existin
       g operations will "jump-start" these improvements. Phasing out income s
       upport subsidies and shifting to emphasis on quality will bring produce
       r competition to the market place. Over the plan period, the public c o
       sts will equalise with baseline costs, but with major benefits to the c
       ountry. All public sector and private sector inflows and outflows have 
       been calculated. All commodity plans are financially, administratively 
       and technically feasible. Achievement of the targets can not occur thro
       ugh piece-meal development, hence the absolute need for the plan. Most 
       of the implementation/co-ordination action will take place within the f
       irst 10 year period of this time horizon. Budgetary increases within th
       e first 10-year period will constitute major national level initiatives
       , which collectively provide large net gains for the country. Each of t
       he Master Plan implementation phases have been structured to reflect th
       e objectives, interventions and strategies. Priorities have been addres
       sed among the sub-sectors, each with definite "milestones" or certifica
       tions to ensure that the scheduled initiatives, actions or steps, will 
       be accomplished in accord with the required schedule.
520    \a The main phases of implementation, i.e. involve review and approval 
       (8 months) and Phases 1-4. The 8-month review, approval and establishme
       nt phase will also involve establishment of the Master Plan Implementat
       ion Office (with Director and 1st. year Work Plan) . The Phases show th
       e intervention applications and the outcomes in,2, 3, 5 and 10-year per
       iods.

520    \a In Volume 4 of these Task Reports, the studies on the assessments of
        land/soil, water, environment and rangeland resources were compiled. I
       n-depth review studies were carried out on various past soil surveys of
        Kuwait. The existing status of soil of Kuwait and the impact of the Gu
       lf war on land/soil were investigated. Assessments were also made of th
       e contamination of agricultural areas by the oil fires. Landuse charact
       eristics were also characterised for Kuwait's Wafra agricultural area. 
       Recommendations were made for soil management, reclamation and conserva
       tion. Water resources were evaluated in assessing their availability fo
       r agricultural purposes. Various sources of water were considered, i.e.
       , underground brackish water, desalinated water, treated municipal and 
       industrial wastewater. Inventories were made of the water supplies (qua
       lities and quantity) that are available.Meteorological and climatologic
       al assessment included wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and 
       rainfall in the agricul tural areas. Assessments were made of the geogr
       aphical distribution and classification of aeolian land features of Kuw
       ait. The sand dunes and sand movements in the agricultural areas were a
       ddressed. The measures needed to protect agricultural areas from sand e
       ncroachment were recommended. The studies previously conducted on range
        development in Kuwait were evaluated. The adver se effects of the Gulf
        war on rangeland resources were also assessed.
520    \a In this report, rehabilitation and management of Kuwait's rangelands
        were addressed so as to contribute to maximization of livestock produc
       tion, while controlling desertification. A proposal is also included to
        evaluate pre and post-war factors underlying the rangeland deteriorati
       on and to develop a Master Strategic Plan that will advance rangelands 
       towards sustainable resource development.

520    \a The physical, chemical and biological variations in the marine envir
       onment affect the migration, breeding period and fishing grounds of com
       mercially important fish and shrimp. Numerous other marine organisms ar
       e also directly or indirectly affected by such physical and chemical pa
       rameters of the water as movement of water masses, temperatures, salini
       ties, and nutrient levels. M arine organisms have evolved within a narr
       ow range of variations in physical and chemical parameters. Living orga
       nisms are very vulnerable even to minor variations. Drastic changes may
        result from industrial activities or from the growth of human populati
       on living near the sea. In many parts of the world, it is now accepted 
       that precise and accurate oceanographic information is extremely import
       ant, not only for biological studies but also for engineering, commerci
       al development and environmental studies. Socio-economic planning, the 
       establishment of industrial complexes and sound fisheries management, a
       ll require a precise kno wledge of the physical, chemical and biologica
       l characteristics of the local hydrosphere, particularly those areas of
        the sea enclosed by land. This is particularly true of such an area as
        Kuwait waters, which have already been exposed to major coastal develo
       pment, because of the presence of an important fishery.
520    \a A good deal of marine research has been conducted in the Gulf during
        the last century, but its strategic importance, together with the inte
       rest stimulated by the importance of the harvests of fish, shrimp and p
       earl-oysters, has caused greater interest in certain disciplines than i
       n others. For instance, land-based meteorology has been conducted on a 
       semi-regular basis for some time; routine reports have been collected o
       ver a series of years, often with interruption in some areas, with peri
       odic publications of data.
520    \a Hydrographic surveys and observations have been carried out from tim
       e to time in the Arabian Gulf; the most interesting include studies by 
       Barlow (1932 a, b, c), Curries et al. (1973), Dubach (1964), Defant (19
       61), Emery (1956), Grasshoff (1975, 1976), the Hydrographic Office (194
       2, 1943), La Violette and Frontenac (1967); Sonu (1979) and Von Trepka 
       (1970). Recently, Brewer et al. (1978) reported the results of a major 
       oceanographic cruise covering the Iranian (eastern) portion of the Gulf
       , including all of the basic physical, chemical and biological paramete
       rs normally studied by oceanographers. Most of the studies covered fair
       ly short periods, however, and included mostly physical parameters such
        as temperature and salinity.
520    \a The most useful of these may be the studies of Grasshoff (1976), Dub
       ach and Wehe (1954) and La Violette and Frontenac (1967). Very few incl
       ude any work on currents; most work reported on currents is based on su
       rface current observations carried out by vessls of opportunity.
520    \a Therefore, the primary aims of this study were to extend the knowled
       ge of oceanographic characteristics, to provide marine environmental da
       ta for the Fisheries Management Project and to carry out systematic oce
       anographic investigations in Kuwait waters. It was planned to identify 
       oceanographic phenomena by dealing with as many parameters as possible.
        Nutrient surveys were not included, but are planned for future years.

520    \a Due to detrimental effects of the relative vertical motion of a lase
       r Fluorosensor system and an oil spill on the sea surface during airbor
       ne operations, it was necessary to develop a trigger synchronization pr
       ocedure which was independent of the motion. This was accomplished by u
       sing the laser radiation scattered from the oil spill to start the trig
       gering process. To compensate for unavoidable electronic delays, it was
        necessary to delay the fluorescence pulses accompanying the scatter by
        passing them through an optical fiber. An analysis was carried out to 
       investigate the pulse broadening effects arising from the use of the fi
