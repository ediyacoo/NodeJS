       The chloride migration coefficient for concrete was calculated using th

       chloride contents and penetration depths were measured after the pondin
       g test, and the Fick’s second law of diffusion was fitted to the expe
       rimental data to determine the diffusion coefficient.  The chloride mig
       ration coefficients from the ACMT and the diffusion coefficients from t

520    \a This paper initially gives general steps of flow-cum-crack analysis 
       using three-dimensional 32 nodded isoparametric elements together with 
       line and bond-linkage elements. An endochronic model is used in which a
        provision is made for the increment of inelastic dialatancy variable, 
       shear and bulk moduli. A set of material parameters obtained by fitting
        numerous test-data is used for the non-linear analysis of the Oldburg 
       containment vessel. The endochronic model is then extended and is linke
       d to a cracking analysis within the computer program OBAID.  Certain an
       alytical results such as displacements for low and high pressure-over p
       ressurization are obtained. The results show agreement in certain areas

520    \a The existing interrelationships between nutrition and other quality 
       attributes of food have been emphasized in recent years. However, curre
       nt interest, rhetoric and emphasis on nutrition have exceeded scientist
        ability to respond from an adequate factual base. One of the key resea
       rch needs is an updating of information on the nutritional composition 
       of foods. This currently is receiving a great deal of attention because
        of the regulatory nutrition labelling proposals for foods. The bioavai
       lability or utilizability of nutrients in food in relation to human hea
       lth and the nutrient stability during processing and distribution are o
       ther areas in which research is needed. But the most important, however
       , is encouragement and support to provide reliable scientific informati
       on to consumers, legislative leaders and all members of our society. Ma
       lnutrition, which means that the body i s not supplied with a sufficien
       t amount of each nutrient, contributes to health problems. Malnourishme
       nt can be caused by not having enough food to supply the needed nutrien
       ts or by not eating the combination of foods that will supply the neede
       d nutrients., A person can be overweight because he is consuming foods 
       containing too many calories and yet be malnourished because he is not 
       getting the nutrients needed for optimal building or repairing of tissu
       es and for regulation of body processes. There are more people malnouri
       shed because of nutritional ignorance and misinformation than because o
       f poverty. Many facts of good nutrition for humans are well known. Why 
       are some of us ill fed? Indifference, ignorance, careless habits such a
       s
520    \a skipping breakfast or lunch, omitting the four basic foods, indulgin
       g in food faddism and setting poor dietary examples for children are im
       portant reasons why many people are poorly nourished. Our income does d
       etermine the amount and kinds of food we ca n buy, but the more we know
        about nutrients, their food sources, how our body uses them and how we
        can cook food so that nutrients are not wasted, the better we can feed
        our families. The need for the education of food buyers in all income 
       groups is important since using a variety of foods prepared in a variet
       y of ways provides one of the best guarantees of an adequate diet. All 
       homemakers should know about nutrition so that they will be able to sel
       ect and prepare foods that will keep them and their families in good he
       alth. The report of the FAO (1962) expressed concern about the lack of 
       national food composition tables and st ressed the importance of establ
       ishing such tables without delay. A suggestion was made that a regional
        table should be compiled based on analyses already carried out in diff
       erent countries. The importance of such information has also been recog
       nised by workers who have prepared tables based on the limited data ava
       ilable in their own countries. These include the Tables by Abdou (1970)
        and Abdulnabi et aL (1961 and 1962). Most of these tables were incompl
       ete or of limited scope. Furthermore, since many foods are common to se
       veral countries in the Middle East, there was an obvious need for more 
       comprehensive data on the entire area. The need for a set of tables for
        a particular region or area is a question often raised. For the Middle
        East, the answer seems quite
520    \a clear. Many fruits and vegetables and leafy plants are consumed in s
       ignificant quantities that are not normally eaten in other areas. If th
       e contribution of such foods is not included in the calculations of nut
       rient intake, erroneous estimates may be obtained.

520    \a Use of cool storage conventional air-conditioning plants has a poten
       tial for reducing peak power demand on utilities.  A unit cooling cost 
       in fils/kWhc, representing the combined result of technical and economi
       c analyses, has been developed and applied to the study of the cost-ben
       efit of using, cool storage.  Residential and non-residential buildings
       , having different types of conventional air-conditioning systems, were
        analyzed on the basis of unit cooling capacity along with a few select
       ed buildings as example cases.  The results show that for all types of 
       buildings and air-conditioning systems using chilled water for cooling 
       distribution, using cool storage is economically highly viable.  For th
       e direct expansion systems, the advantages are limited.  In Kuwait, the
        availability of heavily subsidized electricity, offers very little ben
       efit to the user from adopting cool storage and its major beneficiary i
       s the government.  Changes in tariff structure for energy and power hav
       e been recommended to promote large scale use of cool storage as an eff
       ective tool for energy and power management in Kuwait.

520    \a The project was undertaken to develop national guidelines for waterp
       roofing of building basements. In developing the guidelines, background
        data was obtained on local conditions with respect to waterproofing ma
       terials, construction practices and leakage. The project also covered t
       he characterisation of soil and water in different parts of Kuwait, the
        evaluation of physical properties of locally available water-proofing 
       materials, and the evaluation of water drainage control methods suitabl
       e for local conditions. Information obtained from the soil and water ch
       aracterization, with regard to the concentration and distribution o f c
       hemical substances that are harmful to waterproofing materials, will be
        useful in specifying appropriate materials for new construction as wel
       l as for the repair of existing basements. Evaluation of physical prope
       rties of the locally available waterproofing materials provided informa
       tion for determining, the suitability of the materials for use under lo
       cal conditions. Wit h the large number of waterproofing materials avail
       able in the local market, minimum performance criteria were established
        for use in selecting suitable materials for specific applications. The
        evaluation of water drainage control methods for their suitability to 
       the local soil and site conditions resulted sidelines on effective drai
       nage control methods for local conditions. T he information developed i
       n the four parts of this study (Part 1: Overview on Barrier Systems and
        Local Conditions,
520    \a Part ll: Chemical Concentrations and Distribution in the Soil and Gr
       oundwater, Part IH- Testing and Evaluation of waterproofing Materials, 
       and Part 1V: Water Drainage Control Methods) was utilising the developm
       ent of a national guide for waterproofing covering both new basements a
       nd remedial measures for existing basements, This final report is compo
       sed of two volumes.  Volume I includes an overview of the project, wate
       rproofing, system design considerations, waterproofing, of new basement
       s and remedial measures for existing basements, while Volume 11 include
       s a draft national waterproofing, guide.  The guide includes detailed a
       nd complete specifications of construction methods for suitable waterpr
       oofing, materials to improve the handling and installation procedures o
       n construction sites.  Procedures to remedy existing leaking basements 
       were identified.  The national guide for waterproofing covers all aspec
       ts of waterproofing to insure a watertight structure and to correct exi

520    \a The natural environment comprises complex relationships between livi
       ng organisms (animals, plants and microorganisms) and their physical en
       vironment (water, soil and climate). Nature conservation seeks to estab
       lish a harmonious relationship between human activity and other living 
       things and the physical environment. The establishment of National Park
       s/Nature Reserves not only c an preserve the natural ecological system 
       within the parks, but can also positively contribute to a regional ecol
       ogical balance, natural climatic patterns, scientific research, histori
       c preservation, recreational opportunity and international tourism (IUC
       N and UNEP, 1984; UNESCO, 1984; Batisse, 1982; UNESCO and UNEP, 1984). 
       In Kuwait, natural renewable resources have been utili sed heavily, whi
       ch has often resulted in their rapid deterioration. The misuse of resou
       rces through uncontrolled activities, e.g., overgrazing, uprooting wood
       y shrubs, hunting reptiles and birds, off-route use of vehicles, has re
       sulted in many negative impacts and, in many cases, irreversible losses
        of flora, fauna, and potential recreational grounds. In spite of this 
       situation and until 1980, Kuwait had no protected or managed area where
        the potential for desert parks and the protection and improvement of n
       atural resources could be explored. In response to this situation, the 
       Kuwait Municipality designated areas in its land u se master plan, Kuwa
       it Master Plan, Review 2 (KMPR2), for national parks/nature reserves. A
       lso in 1980, Kuwait Institute for
520    \a Scientific Research (KISR) was requested by Kuwait Municipality to u
       ndertake a feasibility study on establishing national parks/nature rese
       rves. This preliminary study identified an area in the Northeast of Kuw
       ait that combines a variety of animal and plant species with significan
       t landscape features. It is a large area of diverse plant and animal li
       fe with interesting physiographic features, good accessibility, and eas
       e of protection (Taha and Omar, 1982). To promote an 'action plan' for 
       the development of this area, Kuwait Municipality collected detailed sc
       ientific information on the ecological components of the designated par
       k and assessed and proposed concrete management and administration plan
       s for the envisaged park. The second phase of the project, Select ion a
       nd Criteria for Establishment of National Parks/Nature Reserves in Kuwa
       it, was initiated early in 1984 for 22 months (Omar et al., 1984). The 
       major emphasis was on identifying area sizes and uses within the design
       ated area, ensuring the legality of using the site for national park/na
       ture reserve purposes for the present and future, and making appropriat
       e recommendations for the management plan. KISR was requested to undert
       ake the following tasks: 1 . Investigate protection measures for the pa
       rk area 2 . Assess zoning of the park area 3 . Determine suitable plant
       s, wildlife and habitats 4 . Recommend

245 10 \a On the mechanism of formation of hot spots in boiler tubes : \k Arti
       cle File / \c H. M. Shalaby.
260    \a [S.I. : \b s.n.], \c 2006.
520    \a Through a careful failure investigation of boiler tubes that suffere
       d from corrosion due to hot spot formation, an attempt was made to clar
       ify some ambiguities about the sequence of events that take place durin
       g this corrosion phenomenon. In addition, the role of copper compounds 
       was critically assessed. It is argued that the root cause of hot spot f
       ormation is the localized excessive heat flux. The localized overheatin
       g and resultant growth of nonprotective magnetite (Fe3O4) scale were co
       nsidered the primary factors in the initiation of hot spots. On the oth
       er hand, caustic attack was assumed to contribute to further growth of 
       the scale and sustained development of the hot spot at later stages. Th
       is contribution was proposed to occur via localized attack of the nonpr
       otective magnetite scale, leading to an increased pore size and, in tur
       n, an increased rate of diffusion of oxygen-bearing species. A previous
        conclusion that elemental copper diffuses to the metal grain boundarie
       s and causes galvanic corrosion was discounted. This was based on the f
       act that copper was not detected at the grain boundaries whereas copper
        oxide was observed in all tube surfaces separated from the metal subst
       rate by magnetite layers. The hot spot formation process was judged to 
       be autocatalytic as the build up of local, concentrated solutions throu
       gh wick-type boiling required the presence of a nonprotective porous ma
       gnetite layer. © 2006, NACE International.

520    \a This study assessed the magnitude of groundwater pollution emanating
        from direct infiltration of pollutants from oil lakes and contaminated
        seawater used for fire fighting. In addition, the study examined the p
       ossibility of contamination due to infiltrating rainwater and subsurfac
       e contamination from damaged oil well casings during the period of stud
       y. Water fields of Raudhatain, Umm Al-Aish, Umm Gudair, Wafra and Sulai
       biyah were considered in this study. The groundwater pollution study wa
       s subjected t o several constraints including access, mines, and mechan
       ical and electrical problems of wells, which hindered the precise evalu
       ation of contaminant levels of groundwater. The major conclusions drawn
        from the present study are: (a) direct infiltration o f oil from oil l
       akes is limited to a depth of about 2 m in the Raudhatain and Umm AI-Ai
       sh areas; (b) water samples collected from certain wells in heavily con
       taminated areas of Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish show fluctuations in poll
       utant concentration levels, but samples collected during July-October 1
       992 indicate very minor pollution, the present levels of which are insi
       gnificant and may be neglected for all practical purposes; and (c) wate
       r samples collected from other monitoring wells in different water fiel
       ds do not show any levels of pollution as a result of the crisis. Howev
       er, nondetection of pollution at selected monitoring wells does not nec
       essarily mean no actual pollution of groundwater.
520    \a At Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish, groundwater pollution emanating from 
       the infiltration of either rainwater leaching out surface pollutants or
        contaminated water used for fire fighting might have reached the water
        table level but not the intake sections of wells, which are about 5-10
        m below water table levels. Similarly, at Wafra and Umm Gudair, the le
       akage from damaged well casings might exist but not have yet reached mo
       nitoring wells during this study period. Hence, recognizing the importa
       nce of freshwater fields at Raudhatain and Umm AI-Aish, the assessment 
       of the expected long-term pollution of these areas by undertaking compr
       ehensive studies is strongly recommended.

520    \a Using the employer survey technique, the estimation of the demand fo
       r labor in the energy sector in Arab countries stems directly from the 
       corporate plans of the organizations. Based on the current stocks of ma
       npower categories, the forecast focuses on the changes in the energy ma
       nning levels needed in the future. The key parameters are turnover and 
       growth. The study outlines the appropriate methodology, presents a case
        study analysis of Kuwait and offers a comprehensive bibliography on th
       e topic.

520    \a This Development Study-Agricultural Master Plan has been made possib
       le by the initiative from PAAFR, with partial support from KFAS, which 
       together commissioned KISR to carry out a detailed Development Study an
       d prepare this long-term Master Plan. The Master Plan as contained here
       in, is supported by back-up detailed information in separate documents.
        i.e. Appendix I and II, and Task Reports and Specialised Study Documen
       ts. The goal of the Master Plan is to guide the development of a sustai
       nable agricul ture. The objectives are to: (1) increase crop and animal
        yields and productivity in ways that will, assure reasonable economic 
       returns, conserve water and labour per unit of output, and minimise adv
       erse environmental effects, and (2) establish an effective marketing sy
       stem. Supporting objectives are to: (3) increase the human resource and
        organisational effectiveness of the agricultural sector, with more foc
       us on education and management, so as to better absorb the infusion of 
       advanced technology and better manage the intricacies of Plan implement
       ation, and (4) implement financial incentives that will both attract th
       e private sector to agricultural investment, and also assure reasonable
        and suitable economic returns to the participants, while maintaining a
       dvantageous cost/benefit implications for the public sector. The genera
       l strategies for fulfilling the objectives are to reduce the number of 
       priority commodities (to 11); establish quantitative and qualitative ta
       rgets for production of each; transfer and adapt modern production prac
       tices and know-how; detail the other interventions needed to achieve th
       e targets;emphasise reliance on the private sector; assure the financia
       l and economic viability of the production operations; organise the imp
       lementation of the plan; and, schedule, budget and analyse the Plan in 
       its entirety. The specific strategies for fulfilling the objectives are
        to employ technology that will conserve the land and minimise adverse 
       impacts on the environment, contribute to agricultu ral education and e
       xtension expertise on the part of all interested Kuwaitis and positivel
       y influence the social benefits of jobs, careers, and economic diversif
       ication, develop the infrastructure to levels that will ensure sustaina
       bility, and focus the plan to yield returns that are high enough for Ku
       waiti owners, yet not unreasonable from a cost standpoint for the publi
       c sector. The interventions to be used are of five types: technology tr
       ansfer costs haring grants, capital projects, appli ed research interve
       ntions, institutional strengthening interventions and financial incenti
       ve interventions. Over-all the farme rs will be provided incentives to 
       infuse quality enhancing, yield-improving, labour-saving, and water-con
       serving advanced technologies into their operations. Private sector inv
       estments in technology will increase by KD 88 million over the plan per
       iod, and gross revenues will be increased annually by KD 140 million, w
       ith a financial rate of return of 31% and a pay-back of 6.2 years, by t
       he end of plan period. Production will be increased 6 fold and labour p
       roductivity by 2-5 fold,with 20-200% improvements in water use efficien
       cy. The plan will yield 60% self -sufficiency in the priority commoditi
       es, even with a projected 2.3 fold increase in population. Yield improv
       ements will result from achievement of international standards i n prod
       uctivity, and will be achievable on only 69% of the already allocated l
       and. The transfer of the technology, the use of model farms, and the re
       trofitting of existing operations will "jump-start" these improvements.
        Phasing out income support subsidies and shifting to emphasis on quali
       ty will bring producer competition to the market place. Over the plan p
       eriod, the public c osts will equalise with baseline costs, but with ma
       jor benefits to the country. All public sector and private sector inflo
       ws and outflows have been calculated. All commodity plans are financial
       ly, administratively and technically feasible. Achievement of the targe
       ts can not occur through piece-meal development, hence the absolute nee
       d for the plan. Most of the implementation/co-ordination action will ta
       ke place within the first 10 year period of this time horizon. Budgetar
       y increases within the first 10-year period will constitute major natio
       nal level initiatives, which collectively provide large net gains for t
       he country. Each of the Master Plan implementation phases have been str
       uctured to reflect the objectives, interventions and strategies. Priori
       ties have been addressed among the sub-sectors, each with definite "mil
       estones" or certifications to ensure that the scheduled initiatives, ac
       tions or steps, will be accomplished in accord with the required schedu
       le,The main phases of implementation, i.e. involve review and approval 
       (8 months) and Phases 1-4. The 8-month review, approval and establishme
       nt phase will also involve establishment of the Master Plan Implementat
       ion Office (with Director and 1st. year Work Plan) . The Phases show th
       e intervention applications and the outcomes in,2, 3, 5 and 10-year per
       iods.

520    \a In Volume 4 of these Task Reports, the studies on the assessments of
        land/soil, water, environment and rangeland resources were compiled. I
       n-depth review studies were carried out on various past soil surveys of
        Kuwait. The existing status of soil of Kuwait and the impact of the Gu
       lf war on land/soil were investigated. Assessments were also made of th
       e contamination of agricultural areas by the oil fires. Landuse charact
       eristics were also characterised for Kuwait's Wafra agricultural area. 
       Recommendations were made for soil management, reclamation and conserva
       tion. Water resources were evaluated in assessing their availability fo
       r agricultural purposes. Various sources of water were considered, i.e.
       , underground brackish water, desalinated water, treated municipal and 
       industrial wastewater. Inventories were made of the water supplies (qua
       lities and quantity) that are available.Meteorological and climatologic
       al assessment included wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and 
       rainfall in the agricul tural areas. Assessments were made of the geogr
       aphical distribution and classification of aeolian land features of Kuw
       ait. The sand dunes and sand movements in the agricultural areas were a
       ddressed. The measures needed to protect agricultural areas from sand e
       ncroachment were recommended. The studies previously conducted on range
        development in Kuwait were evaluated. The adver se effects of the Gulf
        war on rangeland resources were also assessed.-  In this report, rehab
       ilitation and management of Kuwait's rangelands were addressed so as to
        contribute to maximization of livestock production, while controlling 
       desertification. A proposal is also included to evaluate pre and post-w
       ar factors underlying the rangeland deterioration and to develop a Mast
       er Strategic Plan that will advance rangelands towards sustainable reso
       urce development.

520    \a The physical, chemical and biological variations in the marine envir
       onment affect the migration, breeding period and fishing grounds of com
       mercially important fish and shrimp. Numerous other marine organisms ar
       e also directly or indirectly affected by such physical and chemical pa
       rameters of the water as movement of water masses, temperatures, salini
       ties, and nutrient levels. M arine organisms have evolved within a narr
       ow range of variations in physical and chemical parameters. Living orga
       nisms are very vulnerable even to minor variations. Drastic changes may
        result from industrial activities or from the growth of human populati
       on living near the sea. In many parts of the world, it is now accepted 
       that precise and accurate oceanographic information is extremely import
       ant, not only for biological studies but also for engineering, commerci
       al development and environmental studies. Socio-economic planning, the 
       establishment of industrial complexes and sound fisheries management, a
       ll require a precise kno wledge of the physical, chemical and biologica
       l characteristics of the local hydrosphere, particularly those areas of
        the sea enclosed by land. This is particularly true of such an area as
        Kuwait waters, which have already been exposed to major coastal develo
       pment, because of the presence of an important fishery.
520    \a A good deal of marine research has been conducted in the Gulf during
        the last century, but its strategic importance, together with the inte
       rest stimulated by the importance of the harvests of fish, shrimp and p
       earl-oysters, has caused greater interest in certain disciplines than i
       n others. For instance, land-based meteorology has been conducted on a 
       semi-regular basis for some time; routine reports have been collected o
       ver a series of years, often with interruption in some areas, with peri
       odic publications of data.
520    \a Hydrographic surveys and observations have been carried out from tim
       e to time in the Arabian Gulf; the most interesting include studies by 
       Barlow (1932 a, b, c), Curries et al. (1973), Dubach (1964), Defant (19
       61), Emery (1956), Grasshoff (1975, 1976), the Hydrographic Office (194
       2, 1943), La Violette and Frontenac (1967); Sonu (1979) and Von Trepka 
       (1970). Recently, Brewer et al. (1978) reported the results of a major 
       oceanographic cruise covering the Iranian (eastern) portion of the Gulf
       , including all of the basic physical, chemical and biological paramete
       rs normally studied by oceanographers. Most of the studies covered fair
       ly short periods, however, and included mostly physical parameters such
        as temperature and salinity.
520    \a The most useful of these may be the studies of Grasshoff (1976), Dub
       ach and Wehe (1954) and La Violette and Frontenac (1967). Very few incl
       ude any work on currents; most work reported on currents is based on su
       rface current observations carried out by vessls of opportunity.
520    \a Therefore, the primary aims of this study were to extend the knowled
       ge of oceanographic characteristics, to provide marine environmental da
       ta for the Fisheries Management Project and to carry out systematic oce
       anographic investigations in Kuwait waters. It was planned to identify 
       oceanographic phenomena by dealing with as many parameters as possible.
        Nutrient surveys were not included, but are planned for future years.

245 1  \a Effect of the Fineness of Artificial Pozzolana (Sarooj) on the Prope

520    \a Strength development of lime-pozzolana mortars is affected by the fi
       neness of the pozzolan. This paper examines the effect of the fineness 
       of artofocoal pozzolana on the strength development of lime-pozzolana m
       ixtures. An artificial pozzolana produced by calcining clays from Oman 
       was used in this study. The artificial pozzolana is locally known as ""
       Sarooj"", and is currently being used in a big project for the restorat
       ion of historical monuments undertaken by the Omani Ministry of Nationa
       l Heritage and Culture. The artificial pozzolana was ground to various 
       degrees of fineness, blended with hydrated lime with a ration of 3:1, a
       nd the resulting mortar was used to make hardened mortar cubes. Strengt
       h of mortar cubes was measured at ages of 7, 14, 28 and 90 days of cast
       ing. The experimental results show that good artificial pozzolanas show
        a linear correlation between the Blaine fineness of the artificial poz
       zolana and the compressive strength, but such relationship does not exi
       sts for weak type pozzolanas. The fineness of the artificial pozzolana 
       has its most significant effect on delayed strength gain, with more pro
       nounced effect for good type pozzolan."

260    \a [S.I. : \b s.n.,] \c 2006
520    \a The aims of this study were (i) to determine the seminal fluid param
       eters, levels of serum reproductive hormones, testicular size and diame
       ter of seminiferous tubules depending on multiple testicular biopsies f
       rom non-obstructive azoospermic (NOA) patients, and (ii) to assess the 
       effect of smoking on concentrations of serum reproductive hormones. Thi
       rty four NOA patients were involved in the present study. The selection
        of patients was based on an average of 2 pelleting semonal analysis, r
       eproductive hormones profile and diagnostic testicular biopsy. A detail
       ed questionnaire was used to obtain a thorough history from the patient
       s. The results of this study showed that the mean age of NOA patients w
       ith Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCOS) was 33.875 years, and 47.05% of N
       OA patients have had 2-4 years duration of infertility. Macroscopic exa
       mination of seminal fluid appeared to have normal values as reported by
        WHO. Non-significant (P>0.05) difference was observed for testicular s
       ize and diameter of seminiferous tubules between right and left testis.
        High and abnormal concentrations of serum FSH were registered for NOA 
       patients with SCOS. However, non-significant (P>0.05) differences were 
       reported for concentrations of serum reproductive hormones between smok
       ers and non smokers. In conclusion, testicular biopsy is the useful and
        predictable diagnostic tool for NOA patients with SCOS. Further studie
       s are needed to explain the etiology, management and prognosis of NOA p
       atients with SCOS."

       nment : \k Article File
260    \a [S.I. : \b s.n.], \c 2006
520    \a Varieties of thirteen facies types were recognized in the Kuhlan For
       mation represented by red bed siliciclastic sequences of argillaceous s
       ediments. Examination of the Kuhlan stratigraphic column included seque
       nce relationships, lithology, sedimentary characters, structures and pe
       trography of the dominant rock types. These facies types are grouped in
        three distinct associations of facies. The lower init A comprises asso
       ciation of facies (Distal turbidites) represented by altenates of turbi
       dity sequences including sandstone, siltstone and thick shale beds. The
       se facies types confirm a regressive depositional environment in deep m
       arine shelf conditions. There are three facies types which are identifi
       ed as massive sandstone, cross-bedded sndstone and pebbly sandstone fac
       ies. The middle unit B association of facies (Proximal turbedites) repr
       esents glaciomarine sequences displaying high latral and vertical facie
       s changes of glacioturbidite sediment alternates with diamictites and t
       illite beds. The sequences are affected by eustatic and eustatism of th
       e glacial advance and retreat. This unit B includes eight types of faci
       es. These are identified as; tillite, massive diamictites, stratified d
       iamictites, laminated siltstone/shale, deformed siltstone/mudstone, gra
       ded rhythmic siltstone, massive conglomerate and cross-stratified sandy
        conglomerate facies. The upper unit C association of facies is represe
       nted by shallow marine shelf sequences displaying very thick massive an
       d locally cross-bedded sand bar sandstone overlying the laminated silts
       tone/shale interbeds. The upward gradual changes in mineralogical compo
       sition and color confirms the start of marine transgression and later d
       eposited platform Amran Group.  Mineralogical composition of Kuhlan san
       dstone displays impure dirty rocks consisting of more than 30% of argil
       laceous matrix, 50% of cristobalite and quartz grains, more than 10% of
        ferruginous cement and 10% of detrital iron oxide grains, potash felds
       par, igneous rock fragments and carbonate cement. It is classified as q
       uartz greywacke type in the lower and middle parts and as quartz arenit
       e with subarkoses in the upper part."

506    \a Review Article
520    \a To insure its survival, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the 
       causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), utilises 
       more than one gate to enter a target cell. This strategy makes it more 
       difficult for the immune system to defeat the virus. This has also made
        it difficult for scientists working in the HIV research to understand 
       how exactly HIV infects a susceptible human cell. Such understanding wi
       ll no doubt open many gates for scientists to vanquish the virus by des
       igning agents that can block HIV entry into target cells, thus renderin
       g the virus vulnerable to immune destruction. This will also help in un
       derstanding the replication of the virus and the pathogenesis of the di
       sease. The present article briefly describes the past and current think
       ing of how HIV-1 infects a susceptible human cell, and the dilemma scie
       ntists are facing when studying the infectivity of this virus and apply
       ing current knowledge to design agents that can block HIVs entering tar
       get cells. In the context of our own experience with HIV infectivity in
        vitro, the present article will also address the behaviour of differen
       t HIV isolates, both laboratory-adopted and clinical (primary) isolates
        in culture and the difficulties in performing HIV infectivity testing.
        Moreover, our experience of peripheral blood mononuclear cells� (PBM
       Cs) susceptibility to HIVs infection in vitro is discussed. Key words:

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a An experiment was carried out to study the effects of four pollinati
       on techniques; Bumblebees (Bombus terrerstris L.), plant growth bioregu
       lator (PGB) (Parachlorophenoxy acetic acid), hand vibration, and contro
       l (natural pollination) on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) produc
       tion in greenhouses. Bumblebees showed no problem in visiting flowers a
       t a temperature range of 17-42-C during the day and 2-14-C at night. Bu
       mblebee pollinated plants produced a yield per plant which was signific
       antly higher than plants treated with PGB, vibration and the control, r
       espectively. Fruit set of tomato flowers over 10 clusters was 99.1, 96.
       7, 76.7, and 65.7% for bumblebee treatment, PGB application, vibration 
       and the control, respectively. In the bumblebee pollinated flowers, the
        quality of fruits was superior. The fruits were hard, with more seeds,
        and had a high specific gravity and better appearance. The average fru
       it weight was 100.3, 80.5, 84.1, and 70.6 g for the bumblebee, PGB, vib
       ration and the control, respectively. The PGB treatment produced bigger
        sized but puffy fruits (108.4 ml). While fruit size in the vibration t
       reatment was the highest (126.8 ml), followed by the bumblebee and the 
       control which were 99.3 and 98.5 ml, respectively. Fruit specific gravi
       ty in the bumblebee treatment was significantly higher than other treat
       ments, with no significant differences between the PGB and the vibratio
       n treatments. The least dense fruits were in the control treatment. Reg
       arding the firmness of fruits, the bumblebee treatment gave the hardest
        fruits, while the PGB and the vibration treatments were intermediate a
       nd the control was the least. Average seed number per fruit was 177.0, 
       86.5, 61.8, and 89.8 for bumblebee, vibration, PGB and the control, res

260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2003.
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a To exploit the recent advances in techniques such as super ovulation
        and embryo transfer a sound understanding of the reproductive biology 
       of the camel is essential. One hundred and twenty normal non-pregnant a
       nd eight pregnant female camel reproductive tracts from the abattoir we
       re examined. All the histological slides were stained with H & E. The c
       amels uterus was shaped more like the letter T than the classical Y sha
       ped bipartite uterus seen in other ruminants. The left horn was signifi
       cantly (p < 0.05) longer (77.75 mm - 5.58: mean - sem) than the right h
       orn (59.37 mm - 2.95). The length of the uterine body was 67.56 mm - 5.
       68. In all eight early pregnant tracts, the fetuses were exclusively im
       planted in the left uterine horn. The cervix was very short (3.62 mm - 
       1.32) with 4 to 5 rows of outgrowth ridges and the vagina was relativel
       y long (322.6 mm - 4.21). The endometrial lining consisted of a single 
       layer of columnar epithelium supported by a broad, highly cellular conn
       ective tissue stroma with simple tubular glands. A thick layer of myome
       trium surrounded the endometrial tissue. The oviducts were 140 to 300 m
       m long, larger at the uterine end and opened into the uterine horn with
        distinct circular papilla like projections. The oviductal epithelium c
       onsisted of a single layer of ciliated and non-ciliated columnar cells.
        The camel is a seasonally polyestrus induced type of ovulating animal.
        Decreasing length of daylight appears to be the stimulus for seasonali
       ty in camels. This can account for the various ovarian structures that 
       were seen in the ovaries, which were collected during the shorter day l
       ength months of November and December. The ovaries were flattened, lobu
       lated and each ovary was enclosed in an ovarian bursa. In the mature fo
       llicles, the inner avascular zona granulosa layer was made up of severa
       l layers of cells and was surrounded by a vascular thecal layer of cell
       s. The histological appearances of atretic follicles varied enormously.
        Large follicles (> 10mm) and small follicles (5-10 mm) were seen in 96
       % of the ovaries examined. The Graafian follicles were 13.55 mm � 2.7
       4 and the corpora lutea were 8.92 mm � 0.54 in diameter. In contrast 
       to previous anatomical studies, we have found that the camel clearly ha
       s a bipartite uterus."

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Trials were conducted to investigate the influence of enzyme supplem
       entation on the performance of broiler chickens that were fed diets con
       taining varying levels of date pits. A 3 x 2 factorial design arrangeme
       nt of treatments was used consisting of three diet types (control, 10% 
       uncooked date pits or 10% cooked date pits) and two enzyme levels (0 or
        0.1%). The six diets were fed to three groups of commercial Hubbard br
       oiler chicks (9 chicks per group) for four weeks. Body weight gains of 
       broiler chicks receiving diets containing 10% uncooked date pits were s
       ignificantly (P<0.05) increased compared to birds fed the control. The 
       addition of enzyme to diets did not significantly affect broiler perfor
       mance parameters. In another experiment, three groups of nine birds eac
       h were randomly assigned to each of eight dietary treatments. A 4 x 2 f
       actorial design arrangement of treatments was used (during the starter 
       and finishing period) consisting of four levels of uncooked date pits (
       0, 10, 15, and 20%) and two enzyme levels (0 or 0.1%). The results show
       ed that dietary date pits did not affect body weight gain, feed intake 
       or feed conversion ratio during the starter and finishing periods. Addi
       ng 0.1% enzyme to the starter diets significantly (p<0.05) increased bo
       dy weight gain, but did not affect feed intake and feed conversion rati
       o. These experiments showed that adding date pits with or without enzym
       e to the broiler diets had no effect on broiler performance."

245 1  \a Identification of Some Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) Cultivars 
       in Saudi Arabia Using RAPD Fingerprints : \k Article File
260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2004.
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a The suitability of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerp
       rints as genetic markers in date palms was tested. Five date palm culti
       vars (Barhi, Nabtet Ali, Rothanah, Ajwa, and Sokkari) from Saudi wellkn
       own dates were subject to DNA fingerprint analysis. From 20 primers tes
       ted, only 12 were selected as reproducible, giving 64 bands. The RAPD p
       rofiles obtained were successfully used to differentiate the genotypes.
        Based on the pair-wise comparison of amplification products, the genet
       ic similarity was estimated. The five date palm cultivars showed variat
       ion at the DNA level. The genetic similarity among all date palm cultiv
       ars ranged from 70 to 85%. Sokkary was quite distant from Barhi and Ajw
       a cultivars. A dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA analysis. On the 
       basis of this analysis, the populations were clustered into two cluster
       s: cluster I contained Barhi and Ajwa cultivars, and cluster II contain
       ed Nabtet Ali, Rothanah and Sokkari cultivars. Therefore, the polymorph
       ism detected and its reproducibility suggest that RAPD markers are reli
       able for identification of Saudi date palm cultivars."

520    \a The objectives of this study were to evaluate the composition and me
       at quality characteristics of carcasses from ram lams born to Romney ew
       es sired by Romney, East Friesian X (Finn X Texel) and Finn X Dorset ra
       ms slaughtered at 150 or 300 days of age. Complete dissections of one l
       eg from each carcass into muscle, fat and bone components were evaluate
       d. Weight-adjusted carcass weight and length were greater (P<0.05) for 
       lambs sired by East Friesian X (Finn X Texel) and Finn X Dorset rams wi
       th no differences in dressing-out percent. At a constant carcass weight
       , there was no difference in carcass fatness (fat depth and leg dissect
       ible fat) between lambs sired by East Friesian X (Finn X Texel), and Fi
       nn X Dorset rams. Meat yield and muscle: bone ratio at a constant weigh
       t tended to be greater in lambs sired by Finn X Dorset and to a lesser 
       extent in those sired by East Friesian X (Finn X Texel). Leg muscularit
       y in the femur region was significantly lower (P<0.05) in lambs sired b
       y Finn X Dorset rams than those sired by Romney or East Friesian X (Fin
       n X Texel) rams. Lambs slaughtered at 300 days had heavier (P<0.001) sl
       aughter and carcass weights and higher (P<0.05) dressing-out percent. S
       hear force value was significantly lower (P<0.05) for muscles from lamb
       s sired by Romney than those sired by other genotypes. The results of t
       he present study indicated that lambs sired by Friesian X (Finn X Texel
       ) and Finn X Dorset rams had less fat and more muscle to bone ratios th
       an those sired by Romney, while lambs slaughtered at 150 days of age we
       re fatter and had shorter carcasses than those slaughtered at 300 days

520    \a The physiological behavior, including carbon dioxide production, fer
       mentative index (FI) and ethanolic production of onion bulbs kept under
        total anoxia (100% N2) was investigated. During the first 24 hours, ca
       rbon dioxide production increased from 0.01 to 1.56 kPa CO2, and the av
       erage rate of the increase in CO2 production between 0 and 24 hours was
        0.09 kPa/h. The Q10 of the fermentative index was 1.9. Ethanol produce
       d by onion bulbs kept under anoxia during 6 hours was temperature depen
       dent, and was 0.563 and 0.760 pmol kg-1 h-1 at 10 and 20?C respectively
       , while at 4?C the quantity produced was not detected. It is concluded

520    \a The objective of this paper was to estimate price and income elastic

       licy decisions for both the private and the public sectors. Results of 
       a case study from Oman, an Arabian Gulf country, showed that income and
        price elasticities were small but positive, indicating that fish deman
       d will continue to increase with growing incomes, a driving force for m
       arket development and marketing efficiency. It was argued, however, tha
       t in the long run per capita fish consumption will stabilize but its co
       mposition will shift toward high value added products, a profitable mar

260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2002
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a To increase wheat production, governments can subsidize wheat farmer
       s by purchasing their produce at a price higher than the world price. T
       his policy did not succeed in increasing wheat production in the Irbid 
       Governorate of Jordan, our case study area. The agricultural sector in 
       the study area was characterized by risk in production and prices. In o
       ur study, the supply response function based on the Nerlovian Model was
        estimated for wheat produced in Irbid Governorate. Wheat area, in the 
       model, was the dependent variable in the supply response function. The 
       independent variables were: wheat planted area in Dunums in the current
        and previous year respectively, the weighted price of wheat in the pre
       vious year deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the holding frag
       mentation coefficient in the previous year, the yield risk, and the amo
       unt of rain in millimeters during the early months of the season (Octob
       er, November, and December). The study reached the following conclusion
       s: Firstly, holdings fragmentation was the major factor that negatively
        affects wheat production. Since the heritage system is the main factor
        that affects holding fragmentation, the policy makers need to find a w
       ay that can decrease this effect. Secondly, lagged weighted prices were
        found more suitable than the current weighted prices from an economic 
       and statical point of view. Thirdly, the partial adjustment coefficient
        was low (i.e. less than one), which means that the farmers need more t
       han one year to change their producing habits. Finally, the farmers wer
       e found to be risk-neutral, because their decisions depend mainly on th
       e level and distribution of rainfall during the rainy season."

260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2002
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a The effect of tuber planting date on yield of potato cultivars was e
       xamined during three seasons. Planting date had a significant effect on
        yield, although cultivars showed significant variation in yield potent
       ial at the different dates. Varietal yield was significantly correlated
        with planting date and thus was probably a response to changing temper
       atures during the growing season. The yield increase in some cultivars 
       was attributable to greater tuber number; in others it was because of g
       reater tuber weight. Cultivars Vivaldi, Carlita, Bydand, Donald and Ste
       rling were identified as having the potential for general cultivation i
       n the arid climate of the Arabian Gulf. The results are discussed in te
       rms of a national strategy for potato production, possibly involving a 
       delay in planting date from mid November to mid December, allowing grea
       ter land use efficiency during the short cropping season.

       s proposed for Western populations to an Omani population. Method Ultra
       sound scans were performed at selected stages of gestation on 165 healt
       hy Omani pregnant women to measure fetal growth parameters of biparieta
       l diameter, head circumference, cephalic index, abdominal circumference
        and femur length. The data were compared with the commonly recommended

       esults None of the standard charts agreed with the data in the present 
       study except those of Sabbagha and Wexler for biparietal diameter and o
       f Jeanty for femur length. Conclusion � Since most parameters of the 
       standard growth curves developed in the West are not applicable for ass
       essing the intra-uterine growth of Omani babies, it is necessary to dev
       elop growth curves for the Omani population to prevent over-diagnosis o

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objective: To identify the personality characteristics of resilience
        in contemporary Kuwaiti society, in the aftermath of Iraqi invasion of
        the State of Kuwait during 1990. Method Ego Resiliency Scale (ER89), a
        14-item self-report inventory scale with a maximum score of 56, was ad
       ministered to a sample of 495 male and female students of Kuwait Univer
       sity, aged 17 and above. Students were also grouped according to gender
       , age, type of education, family type, social status, educational bent,
        and marital status to assess the effect of these variables in their re
       silience scores. Results Over one-third (37%) of valid subjects qualifi
       ed as highly resilient, with the males scoring higher than scores than 
       the females. Students from extended families scored higher than those f
       rom nuclear families. Science students had higher resilience scores tha
       n arts students. Conclusion There is significant resilience and adaptab
       ility among Kuwaitis, with males scoring higher than females. This stud
       y could serve as a baseline for future inquiry into strength and resili
       ence qualities of the Arab population in the Arabian Gulf region. Keywo
       rds: Kuwait, personality, resilience, Arab, Ego, ER89.

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objectives: To determine the pattern and risk factors of stroke in S
       audi nationals and non-Saudis, at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (K
       AUH), in the western province of Saudi Arabia. Method: All cases of str
       oke admitted to KAUH in the period between January 1995 and December 19
       99 were studied. Demographic data of the patients, stroke types, risk f
       actors and mortality were reported. Results: Of the 103 patients studie
       d, 56% were Saudis and 44 % non-Saudis with male predominance and mean 
       ages of 66 and 62 years respectively. In Saudis, the stroke types were 
       74% ischemic, 10% hemorrhagic and 16% unspecifi ed, whereas in non-Saud
       is, the fi gures were respectively 62%, 29% and 9%. The frequency of st
       roke increased steadily with age in Saudis but dropped after the sixth 
       decade in non-Saudis. There was no signifi cant difference between the 
       Saudis and the non-Saudis in the occurrence of risk factors for stroke 
       or in mortality. Conclusion: The pattern and risk factors of cases of s
       troke treated at KAUH are similar to those reported from other regions 
       of Saudi Arabia and other parts of the world.

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objective: To fi nd the growth trends in a sample of schoolchildren 
       in Benghazi (Libya), and to compare it with international and other loc
       al growth charts, as a step for setting the national curves. Method: Fr
       om 25th February to 31st October 1993, a sample of 2,022 pupils (1,160 
       boys and 862 girls) were randomly selected from three public primary sc
       hools in three different socio-economic areas in Benghazi. A questionna
       ire consisting of social and scholastic items was distributed to teache
       rs a few days before the examination. The height and weight of all the 
       pupils were measured according to the standards of Jellife, Gorstein, W
       HO, and de Onis. Data were analyzed and compared with both the referenc
       e standard of the United States National Center for Health Statistics (
       NCHS-USA), and the local standards of Tripoli-1986. Results: The boys a
       nd girls in the lowest age-group had a pattern similar to that of the r
       eference population for both height/age and weight/age, but it dropped 
       sharply from mid-school years. The Benghazi curves were consistently hi
       gher than those of Tripoli, particularly for height/age. Conclusion: Th
       e nutritional status of these children, which was good before the begin
       ning of schooling, was negatively affected during the school years. Thi
       s could be attributed either to births in the family and consequent neg
       lect, or to the school�s negative effects on the child, such as lack 
       of appetite created by anxiety or other factors. Further studies from d
       if ferent regions of the country are needed to set national growth curv
       es.

260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2001
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Background: The newly emerging practice of Pharmaceutical Care requi
       res that pharmacists take responsibility for the outcomes of drug thera
       py. Improvement in Quality of Life (QoL) represents the final outcome o
       f the care process and indicates the success of interventions. Objectiv
       es: To assess the impact of a Pharmaceutical Care specialist asthma ser
       vice provided by community pharmacists to a sample of patients with ast
       hma, the outcome indicators being changes in health status and QoL. Met
       hod: Sixty-two adult asthma patients (?? years and older) living in two
        rural regions of New Zealand, were segregated into two groups for phas
       ed introduction to the service. The patients acted as their own control
       s before they received the pharmacists� service. They had been diagno
       sed with asthma at least six months previously, and their asthma was sy
       mptomatic and not considered optimally controlled prior to the study. R
       esults: There was significant improvement in asthma-related QoL (as mea
       sured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) following introducti
       on of the service, and pharmacists were able to identify, prevent or re
       solve over ??? drug-related problems. Conclusion: The results suggest t
       hat with appropriate training and support, New Zealand pharmacists can 
       help asthma patients achieve greater quality of life. This research has
        implications for the introduction of Pharmaceutical Care services in o
       ther countries and for patients with other conditions who require ongoi
       ng management. Key words: Pharmaceutical Care, Quality of Life, asthma,

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objective: To assess aerobic fitness in male and female adolescents 
       using the multistage ??-metre shuttle run test and correlate it with se
       lected fitness variables. Method: The subjects comprised  girls and ?? 
       boys aged - years, randomly selected from two segregated government sch
       ools in Muscat. After the pupils filled in a short questionnaire on the
       ir personal leisure time activities of the preceding week, their height
       s and weights were measured. Aerobic fitness was assessed by estimating
        each pupils minimal oxygen uptake levels (VO2max) using the multistage
        ??-metre shuttle running test (??-MST). Results: Boys spent more time 
       than girls on leisure physical activities, television, computer and vid
       eo games and the Internet. The estimated VO2max in both boys and girls 
       showed high correlation with their weekly physical activities. The time
        spent on television and computer negatively correlated with VO2max in 
       girls but not in boys. Girls had higher body mass index (BMI) and less 
       VO?max compared to boys; BMI showed a negative correlation with VO?max 
       in girls but not in boys. Conclusion: Aerobic fitness in this sample wa
       s higher in boys than in girls and was strongly influenced by weekly ph
       ysical activities in both genders. The ??-MST has proved a simple and i
       nexpensive field test for aerobic fitness that could be implemented on 
       a wide scale.

506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objectives: To estimate the magnitude, determinants and causes of ex
       odontia presented at all the three dental units of South Batinah region
        of Oman. Methods: This is a cross sectional study of 8,963 samples rep
       resenting dental cases reported at the three dental units for 12 weeks 
       in year 2000. The information on patients undergoing exodontia and its 
       indications were collected from their case files. Standard definitions 
       were used to categorise causes of exodontia. Mid 2000 population was us
       ed as reference for calculating rates. Age-sex standardisation and 95% 
       confidence interval of the exodontia rates were calculated for statisti
       cal validation. Results: The annual exodontia rate was 16.67 per 1,000 
       population (CI95% 16.52, 16.82). The rate in males was 11.56 (CI95% 11.
       40, 11.73) and and in females, 40.04 (CI95% 39.73, 40.34). The rate in 
       the 12+ age group was significantly higher than that in the 0-12 age gr
       oup. The rates showed geographic differences. Conclusions: The exodonti
       a rates were high in the study area. Exodontia rates were significantly
        higher in females, persons older than 12 years, and those living in th
       e coastal areas of South Batinah. Based on the exodontia rates, the imp
       act on the oral health services was reviewed and recommendations for im
       proving the dental care were proposed.

260    \a Muscats : \b Sultan Qaboos University, \c 2006
506    \a Orginal Study
520    \a Objective: It has been postulated that geographical locations of the
        herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the deg
       ree of their antimicrobial action. This study examine two samples of cl
       ove obtained from Sri Lanka and Zanzibar and two samples of thyme from 
       Iran and Oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extract
       ed oils. Method: The active agents in each plant were extracted by stea
       m distillation and by boiling. The antimicrobial activities of the extr
       acts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar dif
       fusion technique using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E
       scherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium species, Salmo
       nella species, Bacteroides fragilis and Candida albicans. Results: All 
       oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and 
       yeast tested. Their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activi
       ty, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against S. aureus. The
        lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was
        obtained with thyme oil extract using Candida albicans. There was no s
       ignificant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained 
       from Sri Lanka or Zanzibar or thyme obtained from Iran or Oman. Conclus
       ion: Our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has 
       no effect on their antimicrobial activity. However, further work is nec
       essary to ascertain why Candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of
        sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.
